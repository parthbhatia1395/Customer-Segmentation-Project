# Customer-Segmentation-Project
I did Customer segmentation based on invoice level data of users from various countries.

# About-Project
1) I had invoice level data for customers purchasing various items from different countries
2) I created several user level features from the dataset to do customer segmentation
3) Some of the features which I created were: 
    a) total quantity purchased by a user
    b) total spend by a customer
    c) Total visits by a customer
    d) Whether customer visited in last 60 days or not
    e) No of days taken by customer per visit
4) Based on these and other features, I ran a KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customers in different clusters.
5) Kmeans gave an optimal of 5 clusters
